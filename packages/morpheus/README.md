# Morpheus
Open source implementation of a game engine that can play Morpheus

# History
What started as an attempt to rewrite the game in Qt/QML turned into a web app after a successful attempt (at the genesis of the repository) to create a WebGL implementation of a panorama.  Much of the development of this repo was streamed live on [twitch.tv/morpheusdev](https://www.twitch.tv/morpheusdev) and  and [facebook.com/MorpheusGame](https://www.facebook.com/MorpheusGame/).
